# Readers

Readers is an _experimental_ dart package providing a source and format-agnostic platform for reading and parsing data from various sources.

I am working on better documenting the package and providing examples on how to use it. Right now development is closely tied to the development of [BioDart](https://github.com/FabrizioG202/biodart). Refer to the project for examples on how to use this package.
